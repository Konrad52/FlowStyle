    FlowStyle 1.0.0
    (https://github.com/Konrad52/FlowStyle)

    Made by KonrÃ¡d Kiss in one day on 09.03.2022. (One day before it's use)
    This code falls under the 2022 MIT License.

    This CSS file has everything necessary to make Bootstrap obsolete for
    myself (aka. the author).

    The main reason to create such a stylesheet is the fact that the 
    after-mentioned framework is too bloated and visually unappealing to me,
    while I had to use some kind of helping tool to prototype a website 
    for the 2022 Skills Junior competition.

    This file is for the helper functions used by FlowStyle.
